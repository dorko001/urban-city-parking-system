Python console-based Parking Management System using OOP concepts
# Urban City Parking Management System

This project is developed as part of ITAP1001 – Software Development Fundamentals.

The system demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstract Base Classes (ABC)

The application is a simple console-based parking system that tracks vehicle entry and exit
and calculates parking fees using different pricing strategies.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Run `main.py`

## Notes
This project focuses on design and OOP concepts rather than a full production system.
